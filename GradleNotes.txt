*** Build Tools *** 


# What is build tool
- It is software that automates creation of executable from the source code
- It manages the entire code
- keeps track of what needs to build project like dependancies
- helps in process of compilation, packaging,testing and deployment.

# Why to use 

Build tools automates the process of compilation, packaging, testing and deployment of software source code.
For a small project developer can do it manually, but for large project to create build is very difficult at that time build tools are used.


# Key objectives 
- Task automation
- automates dependancy management
- Automatic compilation of source code

# Problem solved by Build tools
- Reduces complexity in compilation
- helps to reduce repetitive task by automation
- resolve inconsistency - force to download appropriate version of depedancy

# Build tools
- Gradle 
- Maven
- Ant

*** Why Build-Tools

- Automates the process of
- manages the dependencies requires for project
- compiler source code
- packaging libraries and create executable
- run the test
- deploy to the production server


*** why Nightly builds:

- it is easy to identify the root cause of each problem.
- People don’t have to remember about running the build, as it runs automatically, it helps save time.
- it doesn’t interfere with the regular development and deployment
- it helps in fast problem-solving.

*** why to use build tools

- make developer more productive by automating task
- manage entire dependencies
- ensures correct execution order
- Saves the time by executing task parallely
- can automate many build at a time
- precondition for continuous integration


*** Advantageds of Gradle
- It is easy to use and maintain.
- It supports dependency management.
- It provides high performance and scalable builds.
- Gradle integration process is quite easier.
- It supports a multi-project structure.
- The performance of Gradle is very fast and efficient.
- Gradle is a tool used for creating plug-ins and is a flexible instrument.
